# Project Description

Telco Churn was identified for data science analysis and what KPIs can stakeholders focus on to drive efficencies in business operations. Churn affects business operations as customers leave at a the calculated monthly rate resulting in loss of sales revenue. I am exploring the possible KPI drivers that will influence business decisions to counter customer churn. 

# Project Goal
* Find drivers of churn at telco.
* Construct a ML classification model that accurately predicts customer churn.
* Report that a non-data scientist can read through and understand what steps were taken in my project.

# Initial Hypothesis
My initial hypothesis is that customer churn is dependent on contract type. 

# Project Planning 
* Create acquire file for data

* Create prepare file for functions
    * Create columns for data exploring analysis.
        * 
        
* Drivers for churn 
    * Does contract type affect churn?
    * Do we know if increasing costs affect churn?
    * Does having add-on vs no add-on services affect churn?

* Develop a model that will predict churn.

* Draw conclusions
